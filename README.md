# Webbrowser-X
Companion to the Python webbrowser module.
This application allows you to use search terms, not just urls, when using Python to browse the internet.
Example code:

>>> import WBSX

>>> #The file is called WBSX
    
>>> wbs.open_term('google.com', 'how to use python')

No official documentation site. If you need help, you can visit the "Issues" section of this repository and leave a comment.

In some cases, you may be able to use the built-in webbrowser Python module to search for certain terms, but not always, so that's why this application is useful.

Happy browsing!
